        <h1>Asia</h1>

        <section id="ecology">
            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
                <p>Asia is the largest continent on Earth, boasting an incredible diversity of 
                    ecosystems and species. Its vast size allows for the greatest range of climates, 
                    from the icy tundras of Siberia to the steamy tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>

                <p>Asia is home to some of the world's most iconic animals, such as tigers, pandas, 
                    snow leopards, and Asian elephants. These species are not only emblematic of the 
                    continent but are also integral to their ecosystems. Asia's plant life is equally 
                    diverse, with delicate cherry blossoms painting the landscapes of Japan in spring 
                    and vast bamboo forests providing crucial habitats for animals like the giant panda</p>

            <h2>Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>The continent's major ecosystems are as varied as its landscapes. In the north, 
                    the Siberian tundra and boreal forests stretch for thousands of miles, dominated 
                    by hardy conifers and supporting species like reindeer and wolves.</p>
                    
                <p>In the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, lush rainforests teem with life, from 
                    colorful birds and reptiles to rare primates like orangutans. Meanwhile, the 
                    towering Himalayas, the world's highest mountain range, host unique high-altitude 
                    cosystems. These support species such as the snow leopard and yaks, along with a 
                    variety of alpine plants that have adapted to the thin air and cold temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Conservation</h2>
                <p>Conservation efforts across Asia are critical due to the continent's growing 
                    urbanization and agricultural expansion, which lead to significant habitat loss. 
                    Tigers, once widespread across Asia, now face extinction in many regions, prompting 
                    focused conservation projects like tiger reserves in India.</p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="tiger.jpg" alt="Tiger" class="clickable-image">
                        <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">No two tigers have the same stripe pattern, making their stripes as unique as human fingerprints!</p>
                    </div>

                <p>Similarly, efforts to protect giant pandas in China have included the creation of specialized reserves 
                    and breeding programs, helping to slowly stabilize their population. While these 
                    efforts are encouraging, much work remains to address the threats posed by 
                    deforestation, pollution, and climate change, ensuring Asia's unique ecological 
                    heritage endures for future generations.</p>
