            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
                <p>South America is one of the most ecologically diverse continents on Earth, 
                    renowned for its unparalleled biodiversity and unique ecosystems. The 
                    Amazon Rainforest, often called the "lungs of the planet," is the largest 
                    tropical forest in the world, hosting millions of species, many of which are 
                    found nowhere else. Iconic wildlife like jaguars, anacondas, and capybaras 
                    thrive in this vibrant biome, alongside a dazzling array of plants such as 
                    bromeliads, orchids, and the economically significant rubber trees.</p>

                        <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">A rubber tree's latex, the milky fluid used to make natural rubber, serves as a defense mechanism! The latex contains compounds that deter insects and other herbivores from feeding on the tree.</p>

            <h2>Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>The continent's major ecosystems are as varied as its landscapes. The towering 
                    Andes Mountains provide a high-altitude habitat for species like llamas, condors, 
                    and hardy plants adapted to thin air and cooler climates.</p>

                <p>In stark contrast, the Pampas grasslands stretch across Argentina and Uruguay, 
                    offering fertile grounds that support species like armadillos and deer. South 
                    America is also home to the Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland in the world, 
                    which serves as a haven for aquatic life, giant otters, and colorful macaws.</p>
            
            <h2>Conservation</h2>
                <p>Conservation in South America faces significant challenges, particularly the 
                    ongoing deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest, which threatens global 
                    biodiversity and accelerates climate change. Efforts are underway to combat 
                    habitat loss and preserve native species through reforestation projects, wildlife 
                    protection laws, and sustainable land management practices. These initiatives are 
                    vital to safeguarding South America's ecological treasures for future generations.</p>
