            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>South America, the fourth-largest continent, stretches from the Gulf of Darién in the northwest to Tierra del Fuego in the south. Its geography is divided into three main regions: mountains and highlands, river basins, and coastal plains. These diverse regions support a range of biomes, from alpine tundras and rainforests to dry deserts and fertile grasslands, contributing to the continent's unparalleled biodiversity.</p>

                <h2>Andes Mountains and Highlands</h2>
                <p>The Andes, the world’s longest mountain range, span 8,850 kilometers (5,500 miles) along the continent's western edge. Peaks like Aconcagua, the tallest outside Asia at 6,962 meters (22,841 feet), tower over alpine biomes. Highlands like the altiplano in Peru and Bolivia and the Patagonian plateaus in Argentina and Chile add to the diverse landscapes. Unique plants like the Queen of the Andes and hardy alpine vegetation thrive in these environments. Beyond the Andes, the Brazilian and Guiana Highlands feature forested plateaus that support vibrant ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Western Coast (Peru and Chile): Extremely dry plains shaped by the Peru Current and Andes Mountains, including the Atacama Desert, the driest place on Earth. This area supports minimal flora and fauna, but rich copper deposits fuel the Chilean economy.</p>

                <p>South America’s major river basins—Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraguay/Paraná—define much of its geography. Amazon River Basin: The world’s largest watershed spans 7 million square kilometers (2.7 million square miles) and supports the Amazon rainforest, a tropical biome teeming with diverse flora (rubber trees, lianas) and fauna (macaws, sloths, and howler monkeys).</p>

                <p>Paraguay/Paraná Basin: Covering parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, this basin feeds the fertile Pampas grasslands, key for agriculture and grazing. Iconic features include Iguazu Falls and the populous Rio de la Plata estuary.</p>

            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
                <p>South America is one of the most ecologically diverse continents on Earth, 
                    renowned for its unparalleled biodiversity and unique ecosystems. The 
                    Amazon Rainforest, often called the "lungs of the planet," is the largest 
                    tropical forest in the world, hosting millions of species, many of which are 
                    found nowhere else. Iconic wildlife like jaguars, anacondas, and capybaras 
                    thrive in this vibrant biome, alongside a dazzling array of plants such as 
                    bromeliads, orchids, and the economically significant rubber trees.</p>

                    <p>Click the image below to reveal a fun fact:</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="rubber.jpg" alt="Rubber Trees" class="clickable-image">
                        <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">A rubber tree's latex, the milky fluid used to make natural rubber, serves as a defense mechanism! The latex contains compounds that deter insects and other herbivores from feeding on the tree.</p>
                    </div>
            
            <h2>Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>The continent's major ecosystems are as varied as its landscapes. The towering 
                    Andes Mountains provide a high-altitude habitat for species like llamas, condors, 
                    and hardy plants adapted to thin air and cooler climates.</p>

                <p>In stark contrast, the Pampas grasslands stretch across Argentina and Uruguay, 
                    offering fertile grounds that support species like armadillos and deer. South 
                    America is also home to the Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland in the world, 
                    which serves as a haven for aquatic life, giant otters, and colorful macaws.</p>
            
            <h2>Conservation</h2>
                <p>Conservation in South America faces significant challenges, particularly the 
                    ongoing deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest, which threatens global 
                    biodiversity and accelerates climate change. Efforts are underway to combat 
                    habitat loss and preserve native species through reforestation projects, wildlife 
                    protection laws, and sustainable land management practices. These initiatives are 
                    vital to safeguarding South America's ecological treasures for future generations.</p>

                            The southern Araucanía region is home to the Mapuche, Chile’s largest indigenous group. 
                            Known for their 350-year resistance against Spanish colonization and later Chilean independence movements, the Mapuche have a deep connection to the stunning Lake District’s 
                            lakes, rivers, and forests. Visiting this region offers not only breathtaking natural beauty but also insights into Mapuche traditions and their efforts to preserve their environment.
