            <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                    <p>Antarctica, the coldest and most remote continent, supports unique but 
                        limited biodiversity. In terms of plant life, this continent is sparse in species, consisting mainly of 
                        resilient mosses and lichens that are able thrive in the harsh environment.</p>

                    <p>The continent is better known for its distinctive animal species, such as emperor penguins, 
                        Weddell seals, and Antarctic krill, which form the foundation of the Southern 
                        Ocean food web. These species have adapted to the extreme cold, thriving in an 
                        environment that few other organisms can withstand.</p>

                            <img src="penguin.jpg" alt="Penguin" class="clickable-image">
                            <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">Penguins are capable of diving to depths of over 500 meters (1,640 feet!) in search of food.</p>

                <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>The continent's major ecosystems are as fascinating as they are fragile. Beneath the thick 
                        layers of sea ice, marine ecosystems teem with life, playing a critical role in regulating 
                        global ocean health and supporting fish, whales, and seabirds. Even the ice sheet itself, which is
                        seemingly inhospitable, is home to extremophiles, which are microorganisms that can survive in sub-zero 
                        conditions, offering insights into life in extreme environments.</p>

                <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Conservation efforts in Antarctica are pivotal as the continent faces the profound 
                        impacts of climate change. Rapidly melting ice caps contribute to rising sea levels 
                        and disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems. 
                        
                    <p>However, it should be noted that Antarctica benefits from 
                        protections under the Antarctic Treaty, which preserves its environment 
                        and prohibits activities such as mineral exploitation. Continued international cooperation 
                        with this treaty is essential to keep safe this unique and critical region of the planet.</p>
