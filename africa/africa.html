            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>Africa, the second-largest continent, is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Atlantic Ocean. The Equator divides it almost evenly. The continent is made up of eight major physical regions: the Sahara, Sahel, Ethiopian Highlands, savannas, Swahili Coast, rainforests, African Great Lakes, and Southern Africa, each hosting unique ecosystems.</p>

                <h2>Sahara</h2>
                <p>The Sahara, the world’s largest hot desert, spans 8.5 million square kilometers, covering 25% of Africa. Its features include ergs (sand dunes), regs (gravel plains), hamadas (rock plateaus), and oases that support human life. Flora and fauna have adapted to the desert's arid conditions, such as camels conserving water and deep-rooted plants surviving scarce rainfall.</p>

                <h2>Sahel</h2>
                <p>The Sahel is a semi-arid zone between the Sahara and the savannas. Stretching 5,400 kilometers, it faces desertification due to climate change, overgrazing, and deforestation. Its vegetation appears briefly during the rainy season, supporting drought-resistant species like baobabs and zebu cattle. Political instability hampers conservation efforts in the region.</p>

                <p>The Ethiopian Highlands, home to 80% of Africa’s tallest mountains, were formed by ancient volcanic activity. Unique wildlife like the endangered Ethiopian wolf and gelada baboon thrive here. Native plants include the Ethiopian rose and ensete, a banana-like plant. Human encroachment threatens local ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                    <p>The continent of Africa is renowed for its flourshing biodiversity. 
                        It is home to the "Big Five" animals: lions, leopards, rhinoceroses, elephants, 
                        and Cape Buffaloes. The reason these animals are called the "Big Five" is because 
                        they are extremely dangerous, and early hunters could not hunt them on foot.</p>

                        <p>Click the image below to reveal a fun fact:</p>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="lion.jpg" alt="Lion" class="clickable-image">
                            <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">Lions can sleep up to 20 hours a day!</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>In addition, the continent contains vast savannah ecosystems that are home to some of 
                        the largest land animal populations in the world. Unique flora like the majestic 
                        baobab tree, often called the "tree of life," and drought-resistant acacias play
                        a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of these regions.</p>

                <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>Africa's major ecosystems are not only diverse, but they are also extremely striking. 
                        The Congo Basin houses one of the largest rainforests on Earth, providing a habitat 
                        for gorillas, forest elephants, and an array of plant species. This rainforest is also 
                        known as one of the largest carbon sinks, meaning that the diverse tree species and other 
                        vegetation are harboring up to 30 billion tons of carbon. </p>

                    <p>The vast Sahara Desert, while seemingly barren, supports resilient species like the 
                        fennec fox and hardy plants such as date palms, all adapted to its extreme conditions. 
                        Underground water sources, or oases, are vital lifelines in this arid expanse, sustaining 
                        diverse microhabitats where grasses and shrubs can flourish. Even the shifting sands 
                        of the Sahara are home to creatures like sandfish lizards and scorpions, which showcases
                        extraordinary evolutionary adaptations in order to survive one of the harshest environments. </p>
            
                    <p>Grasslands and savannas are among Africa's most iconic ecosystems, covering vast 
                        stretches of the continent and playing a critical role in supporting its biodiversity. 
                        These open landscapes are characterized by their grasses, scattered trees, and seasonal 
                        rainfall. One of the most remarkable phenomena in these ecosystems is the massive migrations 
                        of land animals, such as wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles, which traverse the savannas in 
                        search of fresh grazing grounds and water during seasonal shifts. </p>

                <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Conservation efforts in Africa are targeted towards protecting endangered species like mountain gorillas, 
                        cheetahs, and African wild dogs, which face numerous threats. Deforestation driven by 
                        agricultural expansion and urban development, as well as poaching for ivory and bushmeat, 
                        continue to challenge the preservation of Africa's unique ecosystems.</p>
