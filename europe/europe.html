            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>Europe, the second-smallest continent, extends from Iceland in the west to the Ural Mountains in Russia in the east and from Norway's Svalbard archipelago in the north to Greece and Malta in the south. Often described as a "peninsula of peninsulas," Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south. The continent can be divided into four major physical regions: the Western Uplands, North European Plain, Central Uplands, and Alpine Mountains.</p>

            <p>The Western Uplands, also called the Northern Highlands, stretch across Scandinavia, Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, the Brittany region of France, Spain, and Portugal. These uplands are characterized by ancient, hard rock shaped by glaciation. The retreat of glaciers has left features such as marshlands, lakes, and dramatic fjords—long, narrow sea inlets surrounded by high cliffs. Fjords are particularly prominent in Iceland and Scandinavia.</p>

            <p>The North European Plain spans from the southern United Kingdom to Russia, encompassing parts of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Poland, the Baltic states, and Belarus. Most of this plain lies below 152 meters (500 feet) in elevation and features navigable rivers such as the Rhine, Elbe, and Vistula. Its fertile soil and favorable climate have supported dense populations and agricultural development, making it one of Europe’s most populous and economically important regions.</p>

This region is less elevated and rugged than the Alpine Mountains and is heavily wooded. Notable highlands include France's Massif Central and Vosges, Germany's Black Forest, and the Ore Mountains in the Czech Republic. While sparsely populated, the region's river valleys, like those of the Rhine and Danube, support more significant settlements.</p>

            <p>The Alpine Mountains encompass southern Europe, including the Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines, and Carpathians. This region is defined by high elevations, steep slopes, and rugged plateaus. Europe’s highest peak, Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains, reaches 5,642 meters (18,510 feet). The area also includes active volcanoes like Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius in Italy, contributing to its dynamic landscape.</p>

            <h2>Ecology</h2>

                <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                    <p>Europe's biodiversity is rich but has been significantly shaped by urbanization and 
                        human activity. While the continent has fewer species compared to other regions, it 
                        is home to iconic and once-endangered animals such as wolves, bears, and lynxes.</p>

                    <p>Europe's mixed forests are home to a variety of deciduous trees, including towering 
                        oaks and beeches, providing essential habitats for many species. These forests are 
                        crucial for maintaining biodiversity, offering shelter and sustenance to a wide 
                        range of creatures, from birds to insects.</p>

                <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>Europe's major ecosystems are diverse, reflecting the continent's varied climates. 
                        The Mediterranean regions are characterized by hardy vegetation such as olive and 
                        cypress trees, adapted to the hot, dry summers and mild winters. These ecosystems 
                        support a range of plant and animal species that are uniquely adapted to the region's 
                        conditions.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, the towering Alps and other mountain ranges create alpine ecosystems where 
                        species like mountain goats thrive, and rare endemic flowers bloom in rocky, high-altitude 
                        environments.</p>

                        <p>Click the image below to reveal a fun fact:</p>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="alps.jpg" alt="Edelweiss" class="clickable-image">
                            <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">Edelweiss flowers survive in the cold due to their woolly, white hairs, which help insulate them against freezing temperatures. These hairs also reflect UV rays, protecting the plant from radiation at high altitudes in the Alps.</p>
                        </div>
                    
                <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Conservation efforts in Europe are increasingly focused on rewilding projects and 
                        establishing wildlife corridors to help restore natural habitats and allow species 
                        to roam freely. These efforts aim to combat the effects of urbanization and 
                        industrialization that have fragmented ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>However, pollution and intensive 
                        land use remain significant threats to Europe's habitats, making continued 
                        environmental protection and sustainable practices critical for preserving the 
                        continent's unique ecological heritage.</p>

            <h2>European Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Europe's cultural heritage is a rich and diverse blend of natural, built, and archaeological sites, as well as museums, 
                monuments, artworks, historic cities, and various forms of creative expression, such as literature, music, and audiovisual works. 
                Additionally, Europe’s cultural heritage plays a vital role in revitalizing urban and rural areas and supporting sustainable tourism.

                        <p>
                            European cultural groups are diverse and complex, with over 160 distinct groups across the continent. 
                            These groups are often characterized by language, religion, and historical differences, which create a sense of self-recognition 
                            among their members. While some groups are concentrated in specific territorial homelands, such as the Catalans and Galicians in Spain, 
                            others, like the Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats in the Balkans, share a common language but maintain distinct identities due to religious and historical differences. 
                            In some cases, even within the same language or religion, groups can have strong separations, as seen with the Walloons in Belgium and the Jurassiens in Switzerland, 
                            who speak French but have developed separate identities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The foundation of many European cultural identities lies in language, with each group often possessing a distinctive dialect or language. 
                            In the Balkans, for instance, linguistic differences are accompanied by religious distinctions, and people who share a language, like Serbs and Croats, consider their 
                            language a unique marker of identity. Similarly, the Czechs and Slovaks, despite speaking the same language, maintained separate identities due to their historical ties 
                            to different empires, which eventually led to the peaceful division of Czechoslovakia in 1993. Such cultural divisions highlight how language, history, and religion contribute 
                            to the formation of distinct cultural groups in Europe.

                            European cultural groups are often categorized into 21 ethnographic culture areas based on linguistic and territorial similarities. While groups within these culture areas 
                            may share certain cultural characteristics, they may not necessarily recognize their shared affinities, particularly in regions like the Balkans. In contrast, groups in 
                            regions such as Scandinavia and German-speaking Europe often have a more pronounced awareness of belonging to broader cultural civilizations. 
                            The cultural boundaries of Europe have evolved over time, with historical and political shifts, such as the Cold War divisions and the expansion of the European Union, 
                            influencing how these groups interact and perceive each other on a larger scale.

                            European languages are primarily categorized into three major divisions: Romance, Germanic, and Slavic, all of which stem from the Indo-European language family. 
                            The Romance languages dominate much of western and Mediterranean Europe, with major languages including French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian. 
                            These languages are derived from Latin, the language of the Roman Empire. Smaller Romance languages such as Occitan in southern France and Catalan in northeastern 
                            Spain further contribute to the linguistic diversity of the region. Romance languages have historically influenced the culture and communication of much of Europe, 
                            shaping its literature, philosophy, and societal norms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Germanic language family is prominent in central, northern, and northwestern Europe, including languages such as German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic. 
                            These languages originated from a common tribal language in southern Scandinavia. English, a widely spoken Germanic language, is unique in that about half of its 
                            vocabulary has Romance origins, due to historical influences from Latin and French. Additionally, minor Germanic languages such as Frisian are spoken in parts 
                            of the Netherlands and Germany. The Germanic linguistic influence extends beyond Europe, contributing significantly to global communication, especially through English.

                        <p>
                            The Slavic languages are widespread in eastern and southeastern Europe, including Russia, and are categorized into three main branches: West Slavic, East Slavic, and South Slavic. 
                            West Slavic languages, such as Polish, Czech, and Slovak, are spoken primarily in central Europe, while East Slavic languages like Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian dominate the 
                            vast territories of Russia and its neighboring countries. South Slavic languages, including Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, and Bulgarian, are spoken in the Balkan region. These languages 
                            reflect the historical and political divisions in Eastern Europe and are key to understanding the cultural and national identities of the region's peoples.

                            Europe's religious culture is shaped by a deep history of faith traditions and divisions that continue to influence its societies today. Christianity dominates the religious landscape, 
                            with most Europeans adhering to one of three main branches: Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy. These divisions stem from historic schisms in Christianity’s evolution. 
                            Roman Catholicism is prevalent in the western and southwestern parts of the continent, while Protestantism is dominant in the north, and Eastern Orthodoxy is most common in the east and southeast. 
                            The first major split occurred in the 4th century when the Roman Empire divided into western and eastern segments, a division that formalized religious leadership between the bishop of Rome and the patriarch of Constantinople. 
                            The second significant schism arose in the 16th century with the Protestant Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther, leading to the spread of Protestantism in Germanic-speaking regions such as 
                            Britain, northern Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states.

                            Judaism has had a presence in Europe since Roman times, making it one of the oldest continuous religious communities on the continent. Over the centuries, Jewish communities migrated extensively, 
                            forming two distinct cultural branches: the Ashkenazi, concentrated in central and eastern Europe, and the Sephardi, primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. 
                            However, the Jewish population in Europe drastically declined due to the Holocaust and subsequent emigration, particularly from eastern Europe, where Jews had once formed significant minority populations. 
                            Today, Jewish communities are primarily found in urban centers, where they continue to contribute to the cultural and religious diversity of Europe.

                            Islam also has a significant historical and contemporary presence in Europe. Early Islamic influence was established during the Middle Ages through incursions into the Iberian and Balkan peninsulas, 
                            shaping the cultures of these regions. Today, Muslim communities are found in the Balkans, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and northeastern Bulgaria, as well as in European Russia, 
                            where Kazan Tatars and Bashkirs represent prominent Muslim groups. In the 20th century, the in-migration of workers from Asia, North Africa, Turkey, and the former Yugoslavia led to the growth of 
                            Muslim populations in western European cities, making Islam an integral part of Europe's diverse religious fabric.
