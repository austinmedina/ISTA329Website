            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>Europe, the second-smallest continent, extends from Iceland in the west to the Ural Mountains in Russia in the east and from Norway’s Svalbard archipelago in the north to Greece and Malta in the south. Often described as a "peninsula of peninsulas," Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south. The continent can be divided into four major physical regions: the Western Uplands, North European Plain, Central Uplands, and Alpine Mountains.</p>

            <h2>Western Uplands</h2>
            <p>The Western Uplands, also called the Northern Highlands, stretch across Scandinavia, Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, the Brittany region of France, Spain, and Portugal. These uplands are characterized by ancient, hard rock shaped by glaciation. The retreat of glaciers has left features such as marshlands, lakes, and dramatic fjords—long, narrow sea inlets surrounded by high cliffs. Fjords are particularly prominent in Iceland and Scandinavia.</p>

            <h2>North European Plain</h2>
            <p>The North European Plain spans from the southern United Kingdom to Russia, encompassing parts of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Poland, the Baltic states, and Belarus. Most of this plain lies below 152 meters (500 feet) in elevation and features navigable rivers such as the Rhine, Elbe, and Vistula. Its fertile soil and favorable climate have supported dense populations and agricultural development, making it one of Europe’s most populous and economically important regions.</p>

            <h2>Central Uplands</h2>
            <p>The Central Uplands run east to west across central Europe, including western France, southern Germany, the Czech Republic, and parts of Switzerland and Austria. This region is less elevated and rugged than the Alpine Mountains and is heavily wooded. Notable highlands include France's Massif Central and Vosges, Germany's Black Forest, and the Ore Mountains in the Czech Republic. While sparsely populated, the region's river valleys, like those of the Rhine and Danube, support more significant settlements.</p>

            <h2>Alpine Mountains</h2>
            <p>The Alpine Mountains encompass southern Europe, including the Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines, and Carpathians. This region is defined by high elevations, steep slopes, and rugged plateaus. Europe’s highest peak, Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains, reaches 5,642 meters (18,510 feet). The area also includes active volcanoes like Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius in Italy, contributing to its dynamic landscape.</p>

            <h2>Ecology</h2>

                <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                    <p>Europe's biodiversity is rich but has been significantly shaped by urbanization and 
                        human activity. While the continent has fewer species compared to other regions, it 
                        is home to iconic and once-endangered animals such as wolves, bears, and lynxes.</p>

                    <p>Europe's mixed forests are home to a variety of deciduous trees, including towering 
                        oaks and beeches, providing essential habitats for many species. These forests are 
                        crucial for maintaining biodiversity, offering shelter and sustenance to a wide 
                        range of creatures, from birds to insects.</p>

                <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>Europe's major ecosystems are diverse, reflecting the continent's varied climates. 
                        The Mediterranean regions are characterized by hardy vegetation such as olive and 
                        cypress trees, adapted to the hot, dry summers and mild winters. These ecosystems 
                        support a range of plant and animal species that are uniquely adapted to the region's 
                        conditions.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, the towering Alps and other mountain ranges create alpine ecosystems where 
                        species like mountain goats thrive, and rare endemic flowers bloom in rocky, high-altitude 
                        environments.</p>

                        <p>Click the image below to reveal a fun fact:</p>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="alps.jpg" alt="Edelweiss" class="clickable-image">
                            <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">Edelweiss flowers survive in the cold due to their woolly, white hairs, which help insulate them against freezing temperatures. These hairs also reflect UV rays, protecting the plant from radiation at high altitudes in the Alps.</p>
                        </div>
                    
                <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Conservation efforts in Europe are increasingly focused on rewilding projects and 
                        establishing wildlife corridors to help restore natural habitats and allow species 
                        to roam freely. These efforts aim to combat the effects of urbanization and 
                        industrialization that have fragmented ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>However, pollution and intensive 
                        land use remain significant threats to Europe's habitats, making continued 
                        environmental protection and sustainable practices critical for preserving the 
                        continent's unique ecological heritage.</p>
