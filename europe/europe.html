            <h2>Ecology</h2>

                <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                    <p>Europe's biodiversity is rich but has been significantly shaped by urbanization and 
                        human activity. While the continent has fewer species compared to other regions, it 
                        is home to iconic and once-endangered animals such as wolves, bears, and lynxes.</p>

                    <p>Europe's mixed forests are home to a variety of deciduous trees, including towering 
                        oaks and beeches, providing essential habitats for many species. These forests are 
                        crucial for maintaining biodiversity, offering shelter and sustenance to a wide 
                        range of creatures, from birds to insects.</p>

                <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>Europe's major ecosystems are diverse, reflecting the continent's varied climates. 
                        The Mediterranean regions are characterized by hardy vegetation such as olive and 
                        cypress trees, adapted to the hot, dry summers and mild winters. These ecosystems 
                        support a range of plant and animal species that are uniquely adapted to the region's 
                        conditions.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, the towering Alps and other mountain ranges create alpine ecosystems where 
                        species like mountain goats thrive, and rare endemic flowers bloom in rocky, high-altitude 
                        environments.</p>

                        <p>Click the image below to reveal a fun fact:</p>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="alps.jpg" alt="Edelweiss" class="clickable-image">
                            <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">Edelweiss flowers survive in the cold due to their woolly, white hairs, which help insulate them against freezing temperatures. These hairs also reflect UV rays, protecting the plant from radiation at high altitudes in the Alps.</p>

                <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Conservation efforts in Europe are increasingly focused on rewilding projects and 
                        establishing wildlife corridors to help restore natural habitats and allow species 
                        to roam freely. These efforts aim to combat the effects of urbanization and 
                        industrialization that have fragmented ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>However, pollution and intensive 
                        land use remain significant threats to Europe's habitats, making continued 
                        environmental protection and sustainable practices critical for preserving the 
                        continent's unique ecological heritage.</p>
