        <h1>North America</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
                <p>North America is a continent of striking ecological diversity, shaped by its vast 
                    range of climates and landscapes. From the frozen tundras of Canada and Alaska to 
                    the arid deserts of the Southwest, the continent supports a wide array of plant and 
                    animal life. </p>

                <p>Iconic species such as bison, bald eagles, and grizzly bears symbolize 
                    the wilderness of North America. The continent is also home to unique plant ecosystems, 
                    including the towering redwood forests of California and the resilient cacti of the 
                    Sonoran Desert, which are adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>

                    <img src="redwood.jpg" alt="Redwood Tree" class="clickable-image">
                    <p class="fun-fact" style="display: none;">Redwood trees can clone themselves! When a redwood tree is damaged or cut down, it can sprout new trees, called "clonal saplings," from its base or roots.</p>

            <h2>Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>North America's major ecosystems are as varied as its geography. In the north, boreal 
                    forests stretch across Canada and Alaska, creating one of the largest continuous 
                    forested regions on Earth. These forests are critical habitats for species like 
                    moose, lynx, and wolves.</p>
    
                <p>In the southeastern United States, wetlands like the Everglades provide a home to 
                    alligators, manatees, and countless bird species while playing a vital role in water 
                    purification and flood control. Meanwhile, the deserts of the Southwest, such as the 
                    Sonoran Desert, are hotspots of biodiversity, supporting specialized flora like 
                    saguaros and fauna like roadrunners and rattlesnakes.</p>

            <h2>Conservation</h2>
                <p>Conservation efforts in North America have been significantly advanced by the 
                    national parks system, which has set aside vast areas to protect the continent's 
                    natural heritage. Iconic parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite not only preserve 
                    biodiversity but also offer opportunities for education and recreation. However, 
                    challenges persist, including the increasing frequency of wildfires, which 
                    threaten forests and wildlife, and deforestation due to urban expansion and agriculture. 
                    Addressing these issues is vital to maintaining the ecological balance and natural 
                    beauty of North America.</p>
